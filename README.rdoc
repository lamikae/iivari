== Welcome to Iivari

Iivari is a digital signage system. The goal of the
project is to provide simple and easy to use tool to broadcast
information inside schools. For example, changes to classes, exam
schedules, lunch menu, showcase for works done in art classes, etc. The
focus is on texts and images - audio and video are not supported.

A single server can serve multiple channels with their own content.
Every display needs to have its own client computer that runs a
web browser implementation. The contents are stored in offline
storage that will be used to display slides when network connection is
unavailable.

All slides are fullscreen slides and the slides cannot be split in
smaller sections. The slides are static and there are no transitional
effects. There are multiple slide layouts and adding them is fairly
easy.

Available slide layouts:
* fullscreen image
* text only (fullscreen)
* text on the left, image on the right
* text on the right, image on the left
* embedded external webpage (URL)

The development of Iivari has been done in parallel with Puavo.
For ad-hoc standalone setups, this branch introduces an option
to disable LDAP and Puavo integration.
