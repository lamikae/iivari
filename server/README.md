Iivari server
=============

Iivari is a digital signage system. It consists of client and server
components - this is the server, a Ruby on Rails (v3) application.

See the [installation instructions in the wiki](/opinsys/iivari/wiki/Server-installation-instructions)

**THIS BRANCH CONTAINS A STANDALONE VERSION WITH OPTIONAL PUAVO INTEGRATION**

Checkout from the `standalone` branch:

    cd iivari
    git checkout -t origin/standalone

To create the first admin user, you must do it manually from
the Rails console. After following the installation procedure:

    cd iivari/server
    bundle exec rails console
    > User.create :login => "admin", :password => "....."

To change the password:

    > user = User.find_by_login "admin"
    > user.password = "new password"
    > user.save

To have transition effects between slides, merge in the experimental `develop+superslides` branch. Slide timers do not work yet.

    cd iivari
    git branch --track superslides origin/develop+superslides
    git merge superslides
