Iivari client
=============
Provides a custom WebKit browser for stand-alone kiosk display.

This is a replacement for the [stand-alone Chromium script](https://github.com/opinsys/iivari/wiki/Client-installation-instructions)

Software requirements

*   Python >= 2.6
*   PySide >= 1.0.0 (>= 1.0.7 preferred)
*   Qt >= 4.6

The `python-pyside` meta-package will pull all required Qt packages.

      sudo apt-get install python-pyside

PySide has been included to mainstream Ubuntu repositiories, but pre-2012 releases, you need to enable the PySide community repository.

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pyside
      sudo apt-get update

Build and install the debian package. It is architecture independent.

      sudo apt-get install python-stdeb debhelper
      cd iivari/client
      make deb
      sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/iivari-client_<version>.deb


Setup
-----

Iivari client can be configured via JSON formatted rc file.
Configure the proper server address.

    #
    # Iivari client settings
    # Place this file to either ~/.iivarirc or /etc/iivarirc
    #
    {
            # Server base URL
            "SERVER_BASE" : "http://localhost:3000/conductor",

            # Logger level -- FATAL, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
            "LOG_LEVEL"   : "INFO",

            # Use shell color codes in log files? -- True, False
            "LOG_COLORS"  : "True"
    }


Start the kiosk slideshow:

      bin/iivari-kiosk

You may optionally specify kiosk hostname and screen resolution as input parameters. An interactive JavaScript console is also available in the REPL mode. See "`iivari-kiosk --help`" for usage.

For example:

      bin/iivari-kiosk -n kiosk1

Starts with the hostname "kiosk1".

* * *
**NOTE**: some built-in features will intentionally kill the client process.
This is for the OS to prevent possible memory leaks from happening if QWebView would be restarted programmatically inside the process.

**This leaves a requirement for a watchdog process restarting the client when it exits.**

Such as

      while (true); do bin/iivari-kiosk; done


Test Suite
----------

Run the tests with nose (contains integration tests so ensure the iivari server is running):

      sudo apt-get install python-pip
      sudo pip install nose
      nosetests

Test the display hardware in offline mode:

      bin/iivari-display_test_pattern
